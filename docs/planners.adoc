# Planners guide

A planner defines which mutations should be applied to an output for a given set of data. Envelope uses planners to isolate the logic of applying data to an output from the process that creates the data and from the output itself.

For application developers who are working with Envelope, planners allow them to write data to an output in various, and sometimes complex, ways without having to code that logic themselves. This is particularly useful in Envelope pipelines because these various methods are often very generic, and just need some basic configuration to drive their behavior for a particular data model. If Envelope does not provide a planner for a desired set of mutation logic there is a pluggable API for custom planners to be provided instead.

The data that is provided to a planner comes from the data of the step that the planner is specified in. That data can come from an input or from a deriver. This data that is coming into the planner from the step is considered the 'arriving' data that needs to be applied to the output.

In some cases a planner additionally needs the corresponding 'existing' data of the arriving data to generate all of the required mutations. This is handled automatically by Envelope.

There are a set of standardized mutation types, e.g. INSERT and UPDATE, that planners emit, and that allow planners and outputs to be completely independent of each other. Each planner specifies which of the mutation types it can emit, and typically a planner will not emit all of the mutation types. Conversely, each output specifies which of the mutation types that it can apply, and typically an output will not support applying all of the mutation types. For a planner and an output to be compatible all mutation types that the planner may emit must be supported by the output. There is a compatibility matrix for planners and outputs at the end of this guide.

One example could be for a step that contains the `kafka` output. The Kafka component does not have capability to update or delete previously created (i.e. existing) records in place, so the only mutation type that it supports is INSERT. For the step to write to Kafka it must then include a planner that only emits INSERTs. The only planner currently bundled with Envelope that meets this criteria is the `append` planner. The step may then look something like:
----
steps {
  ...
  writetokafka {
    deriver {
      ...
    }
    planner {
      type = append
    }
    output {
      type = kafka
      ...
    }
  }
  ...
}
----

## Envelope-provided planners

There are six planners bundled with Envelope.

### Append

The `append` planner simply takes all the arriving records and plans them collectively as an INSERT. This is useful for writing to outputs that can not update records in place, such as `kafka` and `hive`.

### Upsert

The `upsert` planner simply takes all the arriving records and plans them collectively as an UPSERT. This is useful for writing to outputs that can update records in place, such as `kudu`, and where there can not be duplicate records for the same key.

The use of upsert logic is known as maintaining a Type 1 slowly changing dimension.

Note that the definition of the UPSERT mutation type does not consider the timestamp on the record, so using UPSERT out of event time (real world) order can lead the output to contain stale data. For event-time upsert logic, use the `eventtimeupsert` planner.

### Overwrite

The `overwrite` planner simply takes all the arriving records and plans them collectively as an OVERWRITE. This is useful for indirectly doing updates to outputs that can not update records in place, but which can overwrite higher-level containers such as tables and partitions, such as `hive` and `filesystem`.

### Event-time upsert

The `eventtimeupsert` planner considers the timestamp on the arriving record, and the timestamp on the existing record (if one exists), to plan the mutations that achieve an upsert in event time. This allows records to arrive out of order and the output to always contain the freshest (by event time) data. An existing record is defined by one with the same natural key (as provided to the planner configuration) as the arriving record.

Some of the planner rules are:

- If there is no existing record, plan an INSERT.
- If the arriving record has a timestamp before the existing record, do nothing (because the arriving record is stale).
- If the arriving record has a timestamp the same or after the existing record, and the values on the record are different, plan an UPDATE.
- If there are multiple arriving records at once for the same key, only the latest by timestamp is used.

### History

The `history` planner maintains a history of all records of a key. Every unique state of the key becomes a record in the output, with metadata columns that include marking the range of event time that the record was active/effective/current for. The planner can accept records that are out of event time order, or that are replayed multiple times, and continue to maintain the history accurately.

The use of history tracking logic is known as maintaining a Type 2 slowly changing dimension. A Type 2 SCD is very efficient and easy to query for the current and for point-in-time records of a key. In many cases it is strongly recommended to use a Type 2 SCD instead of appending record in the history with only a single timestamp.

#### History planner example

An example could be for arriving records that contained the fields `key`, `timestamp`, and `value`. The corresponding output table columns could then be `key`, `timestamp`, `value`, `startdate`, `enddate`, `currentflag`. For the purpose of the example the output starts out with no existing records, and we will consider timestamps to be very short integers to keep the example simple.

First, an arriving record comes to the planner:

[options="header", width="30%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value
|A|10|hello
|===

The planner generates the mutations that are applied to the output so that the output then looks like:

[options="header", width="60%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value|startdate|enddate|currentflag
|A|10|hello|10|999999|Y
|===

The use of 999999 represents a far future date that will never be reached. The planner actually uses '31-DEC-9999' but we will use '999999' to keep the example simple. The currentflag = Y represents that this record is the current record for the key.

Next, another arriving record comes to the planner:

[options="header", width="30%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value
|A|20|world
|===

The planner again generates the mutations that are applied to the output so that the output then looks like:

[options="header", width="60%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value|startdate|enddate|currentflag
|A|10|hello|10|19|N
|A|20|world|20|999999|Y
|===

The two records of the key have been maintained in the table. The range of time that the timestamp = 10 record was active has been altered to one timestamp before the new record, and its current flag has been set to N.

Finally, another arriving record comes to the planner, this time out of event time order:

[options="header", width="30%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value
|A|15|foo
|===

The planner again generates the mutations that are applied to the output so that the output then looks like:

[options="header", width="60%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value|startdate|enddate|currentflag
|A|10|hello|10|14|N
|A|15|foo|15|19|N
|A|20|world|20|999999|Y
|===

From an end-user perspective, the table is easy to query for the active records:

  SELECT key, timestamp, value FROM my_history WHERE current_flag = 'Y';

[options="header", width="30%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value
|A|20|world
|===

And to query for any time in the past:

  SELECT key, timestamp, value FROM my_history WHERE 17 BETWEEN startdate AND enddate;

[options="header", width="30%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value
|A|15|foo
|===

### Bi-temporal

The `bitemporal` planner is similar to the `history` planner, but instead it maintains the history of the records of a key in both event time and system time (i.e. bi-temporality). This allows end users to query the output for how the key changed over time in the real world (event time), and over time in the output table (system time), which may not be the same.

Event time and system time can be different for a number of reasons:

- There is always some latency between when an event happens in the real world and when it is finally visible to end user queries.
- Records can arrive to Envelope out of event time order, perhaps due to race conditions, or due to input replays.
- Records can arrive to Envelope with the same key and timestamp as an existing record, but with different values, which would lead to a non-system-time-tracking planner to overwrite the old state of the timestamp with the correction.

#### Bi-temporal planner example

Similarly to the history planner example, an example could be for arriving records that contained the fields `key`, `timestamp`, and `value`. The corresponding output table columns could then be `key`, `timestamp`, `value`, `eventtime_startdate`, `eventtime_enddate`, `systemtime_startdate`, `systemtime_enddate` `currentflag`. For the purpose of the example the output starts out with no existing records, and we will consider timestamps to be very short integers to keep the example simple.

First, an arriving record comes to the planner at system time 13:

[options="header", width="30%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value
|A|10|hello
|===

The planner generates the mutations that are applied to the output so that the output then looks like:

[options="header", width="80%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value|eventtime_startdate|eventtime_enddate|systemtime_startdate|systemtime_enddate|currentflag
|A|10|hello|10|999999|13|999999|Y
|===

The use of 999999 represents a far future date that will never be reached. The planner actually uses '31-DEC-9999' but we will use '999999' to keep the example simple. The currentflag = Y represents that this record is the current record for the key in both event time and system time.

Next, another arriving record comes to the planner at system time 22:

[options="header", width="30%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value
|A|20|world
|===

The planner again generates the mutations that are applied to the output so that the output then looks like:

[options="header", width="80%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value|eventtime_startdate|eventtime_enddate|systemtime_startdate|systemtime_enddate|currentflag
|A|10|hello|10|999999|13|21|N
|A|10|hello|10|19|22|999999|N
|A|20|world|20|999999|22|999999|Y
|===

The latest state of the two event time versions of the key, and the old state of the first event time version of the key, have been maintained in the output. This is done by:

- Not updating the existing state of timestamp = 10, because this is needed for tracking this state over system time. Instead we only update the system time end date and the current flag.
- Inserting the new state of timestamp = 10, so that with both states we can query how this key at this timestamp existed in the table over system time.
- Inserting the only state we have seen for timestamp = 20.

Finally, another arriving record comes to the planner at system time 29, and this time as a correction to the state of the key at event timestamp 10:

[options="header", width="30%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value
|A|10|foo
|===

The planner again generates the mutations that are applied to the output so that the output then looks like:

[options="header", width="80%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value|eventtime_startdate|eventtime_enddate|systemtime_startdate|systemtime_enddate|currentflag
|A|10|hello|10|999999|13|21|N
|A|10|hello|10|19|22|28|N
|A|10|foo|10|19|29|999999|N
|A|20|world|20|999999|22|999999|Y
|===

There are now three states for how the key at event timestamp 10 has been represented in the output.

From an end-user perspective, the table is easy to query for the active records:

  -- What is the latest known state for each key?
  SELECT key, timestamp, value FROM my_history WHERE current_flag = 'Y';

[options="header", width="30%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value
|A|20|world
|===

And to query for our latest known state of an arbitrary event time in the past:

  -- What is the latest known state for each key at real world time 17?
  -- Assuming that NOW() returns an integer > 29 (because we are querying after the last record was applied) and < 999999
  SELECT key, timestamp, value FROM my_history WHERE 17 BETWEEN eventtime_startdate AND eventtime_enddate AND NOW() BETWEEN systemtime_startdate AND systemtime_enddate;

[options="header", width="30%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value
|A|10|foo
|===

And to query for what was at the previous system time our latest known state of an arbitrary event time in the past:

    -- What was the state of each key for real world time 17 in this output at system time 24?
    SELECT key, timestamp, value FROM my_history WHERE 17 BETWEEN eventtime_startdate AND eventtime_enddate AND 24 BETWEEN systemtime_startdate AND systemtime_enddate;

[options="header", width="30%"]
|===
|key|timestamp|value
|A|10|hello
|===

## User-provided planners

Custom developed planners can be provided by giving the fully-qualified class name of the planner to the `type` configuration. The class must implement `BulkPlanner`, `RandomPlanner`, or both.

## Bulk vs random planners

Under the hood each planner is either a bulk or random planner.

A bulk planner applies the same mutation type to all mutations of the plan (e.g. all records of the step become UPSERTs). These planners do not require the existing records of the arriving records, and so typically plan very quickly.

A random planner applies individual mutation types to the mutations of the plan (e.g. one record may be an INSERT and another may be an UPDATE), and in a specific order for the output to apply them in. These planners do require the existing records of the arriving records, and so typically plan more slowly because they first require a read from the output (this is done automatically by Envelope and not by the planner) and also tend to have more complex mutation logic.

[options="header", width="30%"]
|===
|Planner|Type
|append|Bulk
|upsert|Bulk
|overwrite|Bulk
|eventtimeupsert|Random
|history|Random
|bitemporal|Random
|===

## Mutation types

Envelope defines five standardized mutation types. Internally there is also a NONE mutation but this is not emitted by the provided planners.

[cols="1,5", options="header"]
|===
|Mutation type|Definition
|INSERT|Insert the mutation as new rows. Do not impact existing rows.
|UPDATE|Update the matching existing rows with the values of the mutation. Do not add new rows.
|UPSERT|Insert or update the mutation based on whether the key of the mutation already exists.
|DELETE|Delete the existing rows that match the mutation. May contain non-key fields.
|OVERWRITE|Replace all existing rows with the mutation.
|===
